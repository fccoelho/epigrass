Welcome to Epigrass's documentation!
====================================

Epigrass is a framework for the construction and simulation of complex network epidemiology models. At least this is its main vocation. However, Epigrass can be used to simulate any dynamical system on a set of nodes (connected into a network or not!). Epigrass is written in pure Python and is scriptable in Python, for your enjoyment!.

Welcome to Epigrass\'s documentation!
=====================================


Epigrass is a framework for the construction and simulation of geo-referenced
network epidemiology models. At least this is its main vocation.
However, Epigrass can be used to simulate any population dynamical system on a set
of nodes (connected into a network or not!). Epigrass is written in pure
Python and is scriptable in Python, for your enjoyment!.

<p>To simulate an epidemic process in Epigrass, the user needs to have in hand at least three files: Two files containing the site and edge data and a third file which is a script that defines what it is to be done. Here we go through each one of them in detail. The last part of this chapter is a step-by step guide the Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>

<p>See below an example of the content of a site file for a network of 10 cities. Each line corresponds to a site (except the first line which is the title). For each site, it is declared, in this order: its <em>spatial location</em> in the form of a pair of coordinates ([X,Y]); a site $name$ to be used in the output; the site&#8217;s population; the site geocode (an arbitrary unique number which is used internally by Epigrass).</p>

<p>In this example, the first site is located at <em>[X,Y]=[1,4]</em>, it is named N1, its population is 1000000 and its geocode is 1. This is minimum configuration of a site data file and it must contains this information in exactly this order.</p>
<p>In some situations, the user may want to add other attributes to the sites (different transmission parameters, or vaccine coverage or initial conditions for simulations). This information is provided by adding new columns to the minimum file. For example, if one wishes to add information on the vaccine coverage in cities N1 to N10 ($vac$) as well as information about average temperature (which hypothetically affects the transmission of the disease), the file becomes:</p>

<p>During the simulation, each site object receives these informations and store them in appropriate variables that can be used later during model specification. Population is stored in the variable  <em>N</em>; while the extra columns (those beyond the geocode) are stored in a tuple named <em>{values</em>. For example, for the city  <em>N1</em>, we have  <em>N = 1000000</em> and  <em>values=[0.9,32] *. During model specification, we may use  *N</em> to indicate the population size and/or we can use <strong>values[0]</strong> to indicate the level of vaccination of that city and <em>values[1]</em> to indicate the temperature.</p>
<p>It is up to the user, to know what means the elements of the tuple <em>values</em>. Note that the first element of the tuple has index 0,the second one has index 1 and so on.</p>
<p>When using real data, one may wish to use actual geocodes and coordinates. For example, for a network of Brazilian cities, one may build the following file:</p>

<p>In this file, the coordinates are the actual geographical latitude and longitude coordinates. This information is important when using Epigrass with a map in shapefile format. The geocode is also the official geocode of these localities (the same one used in the shapefile). Despite the cumbersome size of the number, it may be worth using it because demographic official databases are often linked by this number.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="edge-data-file">Edge data file<a class="headerlink" href="#edge-data-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The edge data file contains all the direct links between sites. Each line in the file (except for the first, which is the header) corresponds to an edge. For each edge (or link) one must specify (in this order): the <em>names of the sites</em> connected by that edge; the <em>number of individuals traveling from source to destination</em>; the <em>number of individuals travelling from destination to source</em> per time step; the <em>distance or length</em> of the edge. At last, the file must contain, in the fifth and sixth columns, the <em>geocodes</em> of the source and destination sites*. This is very important as the graph is built internally connecting sites through edges and this is done based on geocode info.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">

<p>See below the list of the 8 edges connecting the sites <em>N1</em> to <em>N10</em>. Let&#8217;s look the first one, as an example. It links <em>N1</em> to <em>N2</em>. Through this link passes 11 individuals backwards and forwards per time step (a day, for example). This edge has length 1 (remember that <em>N1</em> is at [X,Y]=[1,1] and <em>N2</em> is at [X,Y]=[1,2], so the distance between them is 1). The last two columns show the geocode of <em>N1</em> (geocode 1) and the geocode of <em>N2</em> (geocode 2).</p>

<p>Note that it doesn&#8217;t matter which site is considered a Source and which one is considered a Destination. I.e., if there is a link between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, one may either named <em>A</em> as source and <em>B</em> as destination, or the other way around.</p>
<p>If the edge represents a road or a river, one may use the actual metric distance as length. If the edge links arbitrary localities, one may opt to use euclidean distance, calculated from the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates (using Pythagoras theorem).</p>

<p>Once the user has specified the two data files, the next step is to define the model to be executed. This is done in the .epg script file. The   <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.epg</span></tt> script is a text file and can be edited with any editor (not word processor). This script must be prepared with care.</p>
<p>The best way to write down your own .epg is to edit an already existing .epg file. So, open Epigrass, choose an .epg file and click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button. Your favorite editor will open and you can start editing. Don&#8217;t forget to save it as a new file in your working directory. Of course, there is an infinite number of possibilities regarding the elaboration of the script. It all depends on the goals of the user.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>All comments in the script are preceeded by the symbol #. These comments may be edited by the user as he/she wishes and new lines may be added at will. Don&#8217;t forget, however, to place the symbol # in every line corresponding to a comment.</li>
<li>The script is divided into a few parts. These parts have capital letter titles within brackets. Don&#8217;t touch them!</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t remove any line that is <em>not</em> a comment. See below how to appropriately edit these command lines.</li>

<p>A description of these models can be found in the chapter <em>Epidemiological modeling</em>.

<h3 id="part-3-model-parameters">Part 3: MODEL PARAMETERS<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3-model-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The epidemic model is defined by variables and parameter which require initialization:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#==============================================================#</span>
<span class="c">#  They can be specified as constants or as functions of global or</span>
<span class="c">#  site-specific variables. these site-specific variables, are provided</span>
<span class="c">#  in the sites file. All the numbers given after the geocode (4th column)</span>
<span class="c">#  are collected into the values tuple.</span>
<span class="c"># Examples:</span>

<p>These are the model parameters, as described in ref{Table:symbols}. Not all parameters are necessary for all models. For example, <em>e</em> is only required for SEIR-like models. Don&#8217;t
remove the line, however because that will cause an error. We recommend that, if the parameter is not necessary, just add a comment after it as a reminder that it is not being used by the model.</p>
<p>In some cases, one may wish to assign site-specific parameters. For example, transmission rate may be different between localities that are very distant and are exposed to different climate. In this case site specific variables can be added as new columns to the site file. All columns after the geocode are packed into a tuple named <em>values</em> and can be referenced in the order they appear. I.e., the first element of the tuple is values[0], the second element is values[1], the third element is values[2] and so on.</p>
<p>Part 4: INITIAL CONDITIONS</p>
<p>In this part of the script, the initial conditions are defined. Here, the number of individuals in each epidemiological state, at the start of the simulation, is specified. It reads:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#==============================================================#</span>
<span class="c"># Here, the number of individuals in each epidemiological</span>
<span class="c"># state (SEI) is specified. They can be specified in absolute</span>

<span class="c"># N is the population size of each site.</span>
<span class="c"># The rule defined here will be applied equally to all sites.</span>
<span class="c"># For site-specific definitions, use EVENTS (below)</span>
<span class="c"># Examples:</span>
<span class="c">#   S,E,I = 0.8*N, 10, 0.5*N</span>
<span class="c">#   S,E,I = 0.5*N, 0.01*N, 0.05*N</span>
<span class="c">#   S,E,I = N-1, 1, 0</span>

<span class="n">I</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here, <em>N</em> is the total population in a site (as in the datafile for sites). In this example, we set all localities to the same initial conditions (all individuals susceptible) and use an event (see below) to introduce an infectious individual in a locality. The number of recovered individuals is implicit, as <em>R = N-(S+E+I)</em></p>
<p>Another possibility is to define initial conditions that are different for each site. For this, the data must be available as extra columns in the site datafile and these columns are referenced to using the <em>values</em> tuple explained above.</p>

<h3 id="part-5-epidemic-events">Part 5: EPIDEMIC EVENTS<a class="headerlink" href="#part-5-epidemic-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next step is to define events that will occur during the simulation. These events may be epidemiological (arrival of an infected, for example) or a public health action (vaccination campaign, for example):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#=============================================================#</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The events currently implemented are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>seed</strong></dt>
<dd>One or more infected individual(s) are introduced into a site, at the beggining of the simulation. The notation for a single event is: <em>Seed = [(&#8216;locality1&#8217;s geocode&#8217;,epid state, n),(&#8216;locality2&#8217;s geocode&#8217;, epid state, n),...]</em>. For example, <em>seed = [(2,&#8217;I&#8217;,10)]</em> programs the arrival of 10 infected individuals at site geocode 2, at time 1.</dd>
<dt><strong>Vaccinate</strong></dt>
<dd>Implements a campaign that vaccinates a fraction of the population in a site, at a pre-defined time-step. For multiple events, the notation is: <em>[(&#8216;locality1&#8217;s geocode&#8217;, [t1,t2,...], [cov1,cov2,...]),(&#8216;locality2&#8217;s geocode&#8217;, [t1,t2,...], [cov1,cov2,...])]</em>, where the first element of every triplet is the geocode of the city, the second element is a list of the time(s) when the campaign is carried on, and the third element is the coverage(s). For example, the event <em>[(2,[10],[0.7])]</em> means that city 2, at time 10, has 70% of its population vaccinated. Mathematically, it means (in the model), the removal of individuals from the susceptible to the recovered stage.</dd>

<p>Here, there are two options regarding the movement of infected individuals from site to site (through the edges). If <em>stochastic = 0</em>, the process is simulated deterministically. The number of infected passengers commuting through an edge is a fraction <em>p</em> of the infected population that is traveling. <em>p</em> is calculated as $frac{total passengers}{total population}$ .</p>
<p>If <em>stochastic = 1</em>, the number of passengers is sampled from a Poisson distribution with parameter given by the expected number of travelling infectives (calculated as above):</p>

<dd>.csv filename that can be imported into R as a dataframe. This .csv file contains the simulated timeseries for all nodes.</dd>
<dt><strong>MySQLout</strong></dt>
<dd>Use <em>MySQLout = 1</em> if simulated time series are to be stored in MySQL database. Time series of <em>L</em>, <em>S</em>, <em>E</em>, and <em>I</em>, from simulations, are stored in a MySQL database named emph{epigrass}. The results of each individual simulation is stored in a different table named after the model&#8217;s script name, the date and time the simulation has been run. For instance, suppose you run a simulation of a model stored in a file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">script.epg</span></tt>, then at the end of the simulation, a new table in the epigrass database will be created with the following name: <em>script_Wed_Jan_26_154411_2005</em>. Thus, the results of multiple runs from the same model get stored independently.</dd>

<h2 id="the-graphical-user-interface-gui">The Graphical User Interface(GUI)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-graphical-user-interface-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Epigrass comes with a simple but effective GUI(figure ref{fig:gui}), that allows the user to control some aspects of the run-time behavior of the system. The Gui can be invoked by typing texttt{epigrass} in prompt of a console. We suggest the user to start Epigrass from the same directory where his/her model definition is located (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.csv</span></tt> and   <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.epg</span></tt> files).</p>
<p>All the information that is entered via the GUI gets  stored in a hidden file called texttt{.epigrassrc} stored in the home folder of the user. Every time the GUI is invoked, the data stored in the texttt{.epigrassrc} file is used to fill the forms in the GUI. The gui is designed as a tabbed notebook with four tabs (Run Options, Settings, Utilities, and Visualization).</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Gui there are three buttons texttt{Help}, texttt{Start} and texttt{Exit}. Their functions will be explained below. Immediately above the texttt{Run} and texttt{Exit} buttons, there is a small numeric display that will display the simulation progress after it has been started.</p>
<img alt="_images/epigrass1.png" src="_images/epigrass1.png" />
<div class="section">
<h3 id="run-options">Run Options<a class="headerlink" href="#run-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first tab of the GUI(figure ref{fig:gui}), contains a number of variables that, with the exception of the model script filename, should remain the same for most simulations you are going to run.</p>
<p>On the top of the first tab is a text box to enter the file name of the model script (texttt{something.epg}). By clicking on the <strong>Choose</strong> button at the right of this box, you get a file selection dialog to select your script file. If you need you can click on the texttt{Edit} button below to edit the script file with your favorite text editor.</p>
<p>Below, you can enter details about the MySQL database that will store the output of your simulations. Here you can enter the server IP, port, user and password. On the first time you run the GUI these input boxes will be filled with the default values for these variables (server on localhost, port 3306, user epigrass and password epigrass)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="settings">Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the settings page, you can enter personal details such as user name (To be used in the simulation report), preferred text editor and preferred PDF reader. The preferred text editor will be used to open your script from the GUI, when you click on the edit button in the first tab. The PDF reader specified, will be used to open the report file, when requested (Utilities tab) and the user manual, when the user clicks on the help button on the bottom-left corner of the GUI.</p>
<p>On this tab, the language of the GUI can also be selected from a list of available translations. The effects of language changes will only take place when the next time the GUI is started.</p>
<img alt="_images/epigrass2.png" src="_images/epigrass2.png" />
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="utilities">Utilities<a class="headerlink" href="#utilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the Utilities tab, you can get feed back from the simulator. Especially during long simulation runs, it is good to know how it is progressing. During the simulation, text messages regarding the status of the simulation are written to the text box on the left.</p>
<p>On the right, there is a button for backing up the data base and another for opening the report generated by the last simulation. Since report PDFs ar stored in folder directly below the ones on which the simulation is started, older reports should still be accessible and can be opened directly by selecting the desired report using the operating system&#8217;s file manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="visualization">Visualization<a class="headerlink" href="#visualization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The fourth tab of the GUI is the visualization Tab. This tab was designed for playing animations of any simulation data that is stored in the database. Pressin the texttt{Scan DB} button, causes the available tables in the  epigrass database to be listed in the texttt{Simulations stored} combo box. The user can then select one of these simulations to visualize.</p>
<p>Once the texttt{Start animation} button is pressed, a graphical display window pops up, and the simulation is replayed at a speed given by the frame rate set by the user  or the maximum speed of the computer (whichever is smaller). In the animation, the nodes of the network are represented by boxes whose volume is given by the number of infected at each node. The node colors are as following: Green for uninfected nodes, and red to blue for infected nodes. bright red for for first infected node with the nodes becoming infected later assuming a color with progressively more blue.</p>
<p>Maps can also be selected from the texttt{Maps availabled combo box} to be used as background for the network display. The maps must be in the GRASS ascii vectorial format and have coordinates compatible with those given to the nodes of the simulation.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 id="operation">Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After all the information has been entered and checked on the GUI, you can press the <strong>Run</strong> button to start the simulation or the :guilabel`Exit` button. When the <strong>Run</strong> button is pressed, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.epigrassrc</span></tt> file is updated with all the information entered in the gui. If the <strong>Exit</strong> button is pressed, all information entered since the last time the <strong>Run</strong> button was pressed is lost.</p>

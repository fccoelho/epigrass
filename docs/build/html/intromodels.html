Epidemiological models
:::</p>
<p>Epidemiological models are implemented in the EpiGrass environment as a
tool to predict, understand and develop strategies to control the spread
of infectious diseases at different time/spatial scales. In this
context, there are two direct potential applications. One is to model
the spread of new diseases through an entirely susceptible population
(ecological invasion). The velocity of spread of new diseases in a
network of susceptible populations depends on their spatial
distribution, size, susceptibility and patterns of contact. In a spatial
scale, climate and environment may also impact the dynamics of
geographical spread as it introduces temporal and spatial heterogeneity.
Understanding and predicting the direction and velocity of an invasion
wave is key for emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>Besides invasion, network epidemiological models can also be used to
understand patterns of geographical spread of endemic diseases. Many
infectious diseases can only be maintained in a endemic state in cities
with population size above a threshold, or under appropriate
environmental conditions (climate, availability of a reservoir, vectors,
etc). The variables and the magnitudes associated with endemicity
threshold depends on the natural history of the disease
cite{MJKeelingandBTGrenfell1997}. Theses magnitudes may vary from place
to place as it depends on the contact structure of the individuals.
Predicting which cities are sources for the endemicity and understanding
the path of recurrent traveling waves may help us to design optimal
surveillance and control strategies. For measles, for example, models
suggest that geographical spread tend to follow a hierarchical pattern,
starting in big cities (core) and then spreading to smaller neighborhood
cities (satellites) cite{BTGrenfellandONBjoernstadandJKappey2001}.</p>
<p>EpiGrass implements a series of epidemiological models which, integrated
with a set of analytical and visualization tools, may give us clues
about the overall pattern of diseases spread in the geographical space.
Besides, it can be used for scenario analysis to compare alternative
intervention scenarios.</p>

<h2>Disease models<a class="headerlink" href="#disease-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Models of disease dynamics are quite diverse, ranging from caricatures
to very detailed simulations. Traditional models of spread of diseases
are based on the mean field assumption, i.e., that individuals interact
randomly at a certain rate. Important references to the subject are
cite{DiekmannOandHeesterbeekJAP2000,DaleyDJandGaniJandCanningsC2001,IshamVandMedleyG1996,AndersonRMandMayRMandAndersonB1992}.
These models are expressed mathematically as difference equations
(discrete time) or differential equations (continuous time). In the
simplest form, these models do not take into consideration either
individual heterogeneity or the local nature of transmission events.
Increased realism is achieved by structuring the population according to
age, risk behavior, sex, susceptibility, or other category associated
with different risk of getting or transmitting the disease. Within each
sub-population, however, the assumption of well mixing must hold. When
other species are involved in the transmission process (non-human hosts
and vectors), these are also considered as compartments that may be
sub-divided as well according to covariates associated with the risk of
acquiring or transmitting the disease.</p>
<p>In this context, epidemiological models take the form of
multi-compartmental models where each compartment is a well-mixed
homogeneous population. The model describes the transition of the
individuals in this population through a sequence of disease-related
stages. These stages could be <em>Susceptible</em>, <em>Infected</em>, <em>Recovered</em>,
for example. And the transitions could be .. math:: Susceptible
longrightarrow Infected .. math:: Infected longrightarrow Recovered</p>
<p>If only these transitions are allowed, then individuals in the recovered
class never become susceptible again (lifelong immunity). If, on the
other hand, immunity is only temporary (as in pertussis), then another
transition should be included: .. math:: Susceptible longrightarrow
Infected .. math:: Infected longrightarrow Recovered .. math:: Recovered
longrightarrow Susceptible</p>
<p>One way to visualize these models is using state-flow diagrams, where
boxes represent states (compartments) and arrows indicate the
transitions. It is the state identity together with the transitions
allowed that define the type of model in use.</p>

<h3>Dispersal of infected individuals<a class="headerlink" href="#dispersal-of-infected-individuals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A key feature of EpiGrass is to allow the simulation of geographical
spread of infection from one locality to others. Dispersal of infection
is modeled as in a ‘forest fire’ model
cite{BTGrenfellandONBjoernstadandJKappey2001}. An infected individual,
traveling to another city, acts as a spark that may trigger an epidemic
in the new locality. This approach is based on the assumption that
individuals commute between localities and contribute temporarily to the
number of infected in the new locality, but not to its demography.
Further details about this approach can be found in Grenfell et al
(2001).</p>
<p>In all models presented below, new infections in locality $i$ arise from
the contact between Susceptibles in $i$ and Infectious individuals.
Infectious individuals are of two types: those residents in $i$ $(I_t)$
and those visiting $i$ $(\theta)$. Mathematically, this is written as:</p>
<p>$$L_{t+1} = \beta S_t \frac{(I_t+\theta)^\alpha} {N_t+n_t}$$</p>
<p>where $L_{t+1}$ is the number of new cases, $\beta$ is the contact rate
between Susceptibles and Infectious individuals, $S_t$ is the number of
susceptibles, $I_t$ is the number of infectious individuals resident in
the locality, $\theta$ is the number of infectious individuals visiting
the locality, $N_t$ is the population residing in the locality and $n_t$
is the total number of individuals visiting the locality. $\alpha$ is a
mixing parameter. $\alpha=1$ corresponds to homogeneous mixing
(Finkenstadt and Grenfell, 2000).</p>

Models;typology
:::</p>
<p>Here we present a brief description of the typology of infectious
diseases models based on the main route of transmission, and type of
immunity resulting from infection. These models correspond to the types
of models built into EpiGrass.</p>
<div class="section" id="sir-like-models">
<h4>SIR-like models<a class="headerlink" href="#sir-like-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The natural history of many directly transmitted infectious diseases can
be appropriately described by a SIR-like model. <em>SIR</em> stands for
Susceptible $(S)$, Infected $(I)$ and Recovered $(R)$. Archetypal <em>SIRs</em>
are measles or chickenpox, i.e., diseases that confer lifelong immunity
(but see cite{KGlassandBTGrenfell2004}). An individual starts his life
in the $S$ state and may progress to the $I$ state. The rate of
progression of individuals from $S$ to $I$ is called the incidence rate
or force of infection $(\lambda)$ which is a function of contact rate,
probability of transmission per contact and density of infectious
individuals. Individuals stay in the infectious period for a certain
time and then move to the recovered state where they become immune to
new infections. Generally, the removal rate from the infectious class is
the inverse of the infectious period (i.e., it is assumed that the
duration of infection is exponentially distributed).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Figure: SIR-like models</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Variations of this model allow cases where infected individuals do not
acquire immunity after infection, thus returning to the susceptible pool
(<em>SIS</em> model). Another variation is the inclusion of a latent stage to
hold individuals that are infected but not infectious to others yet
(incubation period). These are the <em>SEIR</em> (with immunity) and <em>SEIS</em> (no
immunity) models.</p>
<p>Next, we describe in more detail each one of these models in their
deterministic and stochastic versions, as used by EpiGrass.</p>

<p><strong>SIR models</strong></p>
<p>:   Examples of diseases represented by SIR models are measles,
chickenpox. Some diseases that do not confer lifelong immunity may
be represented by this model if only short term dynamics is of
interest. In the scale of a year, influenza and pertussis, for
example, could be described using SIR. The SIR model is implemented
in EpiGrass as a system of four difference equations. Besides the
three equations describing the dynamics of $S$, $I$ and $R$, a
fourth equation explicitly defines the number of new cases per time
step, $L(t)$ (i.e., the incidence). In general, this quantity is
embedded in the $I$ equation (prevalence), but it is important to
keep track of the incidence if one wishes to compare prediction with
notification data.</p>

This is the latent period and it is often parameterized as the
inverse of the incubation period. Note, however, that for many
diseases, initiation of infectiousness does not necessarily
coincides with symptoms. In principle, any disease described by the
SIR model can also be described by the SEIR model. The decision
regarding the use of one or another depends on the magnitude of the
latent period in relation to the time frame of other events in the
simulation. The model has the form:</p>

more than one distinct populations. Vector borne diseases are classical
examples where a SIR model is used to describe infection in humans and
another SIR-like model is used to describe infection in the vector

expressions found in the deterministic models. The user may choose the
probability distribution for $L_{t+1}$ between Poisson or Negative
Binomial to draw realizations of $L_{t+1}$:</p>

Models;transportation
:::</p>
<p>The transmission models describe the dynamics of infection in a
well-mixed population. EpiGrass allows the user to model the movement of
infectious individuals between well-mixed populations, thus simulating
the spread of disease through space. EpiGrass represents geographical
space as a network where cities or localities are nodes and
transportation routes are edges. The term network refers to the
framework of routes within a system of locations, identified as nodes or
sites. An edge is a single link between two sites (a road, a railroad,
an air route or a river/sea corridor).</p>
<p>Transportation networks, like many networks, are generally embodied as
set of locations and a set of links representing connections between
those locations. The arrangement and connectivity of a network is known
as its <em>topology</em>. Major types of topology are illustrated in figure
ref{fig:artgraphs}. Velocity and direction of disease spread depend on
the topology and weight of the edges of the transport network and there
are many properties of networks that may useful when analyzing the
spread of diseases. EpiGrass calculates a set of these properties as
described in chapter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">analysis</span></code>{.interpreted-text role=”ref”}.</p>
<p>In a transportation network, each edge (or link) is characterized by a
variable <em>flow</em> which states the number of passengers that travel
through that link per unit time. EpiGrass uses this information to
calculate the number of passengers arriving at each city, per time step.
For example, consider node $N1$ in figure <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">simpnet</span></code>{.interpreted-text
role=”ref”}. At each time step, it receives 10 passengers from $N2$, 5
from $N5$, 1 from $N4$. Now suppose that, at this time step, 10% of the
population within each site is infectious ($I$ state), according to the
epidemic model. Thus, a total of
$10% \times 10 + 10% \times 5 + 10% \times 1 = 1.6$ infectious
individuals are visiting site $N1$. In the epidemic model embedded in
$N1$, EpiGrass sets $n = 16$ and $\theta = 1.6$. This calculation of
$\theta$ is based on a deterministic argument. The other possibility,
allowed by Epigrass, is to define $\theta$ as a random variable, that
follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$,$p$, where $n$ is as
given in the deterministic version and $p$ is the proportion of
infectious individuals in the source population. From version 1.4 on,
EpiGrass can also take into account the specific delays of each
connection. When the average speed of the transportation system is set
to a value greater than zero, epigrass calculates the time required to
complete each trip and attributes this delay (in units of time) to the
parameter $\delta$. So, the number of infectious passengers arriving at
any given city, at time $t$ corresponds to the number of infectious
passengers that left the city of origin at time $t-\delta$.</p>
<p>Deterministic:</p>
<p>$$\Theta_t=n\times\frac{I_{t-\delta}}{N}$$</p>
<p>Stochastic:</p>
<p>$$\Theta_t \sim Binomial(N,\frac{I_{t-\delta}}{N})$$$$A simple transportation network$$</p>

<p id="index-1">Epidemiological models are implemented in the EpiGrass environment as a tool to predict, understand and develop strategies to control the spread of infectious diseases at different time/spatial scales. In this context, there are two direct potential applications. One is to model the spread of new diseases through an entirely susceptible population (ecological invasion). The velocity of spread of new diseases in a network of susceptible populations depends on their spatial distribution, size, susceptibility and patterns of contact. In a spatial scale, climate and environment may also impact the dynamics of geographical spread as it introduces temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Understanding and predicting the direction and velocity of an invasion wave is key for emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>Besides invasion, network epidemiological models can also be used to understand patterns of geographical spread of endemic diseases. Many infectious diseases can only be maintained in a endemic state in cities with population size above a threshold, or under appropriate environmental conditions (climate, availability of a reservoir, vectors, etc). The variables and the magnitudes associated with endemicity threshold depends on the natural history of the disease cite{MJKeelingandBTGrenfell1997}. Theses magnitudes may vary from place to place as it depends on the contact structure of the individuals. Predicting which cities are sources for the endemicity and understanding the path of recurrent traveling waves may help us to design optimal surveillance and control strategies. For measles, for example, models suggest that geographical spread tend to follow a hierarchical pattern, starting in big cities (core) and then spreading to smaller neighborhood cities (satellites) cite{BTGrenfellandONBjoernstadandJKappey2001}.</p>
<p>EpiGrass implements a series of epidemiological models which, integrated with a set of analytical and visualization tools,  may give us clues about the overall pattern of diseases spread in the geographical space. Besides, it can be used for scenario analysis to compare alternative intervention scenarios.</p>

<h2>Disease models<a class="headerlink" href="#disease-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Models of disease dynamics are quite diverse, ranging from caricatures
to very detailed simulations. Traditional models of spread of diseases
are based on the mean field assumption, i.e., that individuals
interact randomly at a certain rate. Important references to the
subject are
cite{DiekmannOandHeesterbeekJAP2000,DaleyDJandGaniJandCanningsC2001,IshamVandMedleyG1996,AndersonRMandMayRMandAndersonB1992}.
These models are expressed mathematically as difference equations
(discrete time) or differential equations (continuous time). In the
simplest form, these models do not take into consideration either
individual heterogeneity or the local nature of transmission
events. Increased realism is achieved by structuring the population according to age, risk behavior, sex, susceptibility, or other category associated with different risk of getting or transmitting the disease. Within each sub-population, however, the assumption of well mixing must hold. When other species are involved in the transmission process (non-human hosts and vectors), these are also considered as compartments that may be sub-divided as well according to covariates associated with the risk of acquiring or transmitting the disease.</p>
<p>In this context, epidemiological models take the form of multi-compartmental models where each compartment is a well-mixed homogeneous population. The model describes the transition of the individuals in this population through a sequence of disease-related stages. These stages could be <em>Susceptible</em>, <em>Infected</em>, <em>Recovered</em>, for example. And the transitions could be
.. math:: Susceptible longrightarrow Infected
.. math:: Infected longrightarrow Recovered</p>
<p>If only these transitions are allowed, then individuals in the recovered class never become susceptible again (lifelong immunity). If, on the other hand, immunity is only temporary (as in pertussis), then another transition should be included:
.. math:: Susceptible longrightarrow Infected
.. math:: Infected longrightarrow Recovered
.. math:: Recovered longrightarrow Susceptible</p>
<p>One way to visualize these models is using state-flow diagrams, where boxes represent states (compartments) and arrows indicate the transitions. It is the state identity together with the transitions allowed that define the type of model in use.</p>

<h3>Dispersal of infected individuals<a class="headerlink" href="#dispersal-of-infected-individuals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A key feature of EpiGrass is to allow the simulation of geographical spread of infection from one locality to others. Dispersal of infection is modeled as in a ‘forest fire’ model cite{BTGrenfellandONBjoernstadandJKappey2001}. An infected individual, traveling to another city, acts as a spark that may trigger an epidemic in the new locality. This approach is based on the assumption that individuals commute between localities and contribute temporarily to the number of infected in the new locality, but not to its demography. Further details about this approach can be found in Grenfell et al (2001).</p>
<p>In all models presented below, new infections in locality <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> arise from the contact between Susceptibles in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and Infectious individuals. Infectious individuals are of two types: those residents in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((I_t)\)</span> and those visiting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\theta)\)</span>. Mathematically, this is written as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[L_{t+1} = \beta S_t \frac{(I_t+\theta)^\alpha} {N_t+n_t}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{t+1}\)</span> is the number of new cases, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> is the contact rate between Susceptibles and Infectious individuals, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_t\)</span> is the number of susceptibles, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I_t\)</span> is the number of infectious individuals resident in the locality, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is the number of infectious individuals visiting the locality, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_t\)</span> is the population residing in the locality and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_t\)</span> is the total number of individuals visiting the locality. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> is a mixing parameter. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha=1\)</span> corresponds to homogeneous mixing (Finkenstadt and Grenfell, 2000).</p>

<h3>Typology of infectious diseases and corresponding models<a class="headerlink" href="#typology-of-infectious-diseases-and-corresponding-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-2">Here we present a brief description of the typology of infectious
diseases models based on the main route of transmission, and type of
immunity resulting from infection. These models correspond to the
types of models built into EpiGrass.</p>
<div class="section" id="sir-like-models">
<h4>SIR-like models<a class="headerlink" href="#sir-like-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The natural history of many directly transmitted infectious diseases can be appropriately described by a SIR-like model. <em>SIR</em> stands for Susceptible <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((S)\)</span>, Infected <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((I)\)</span> and Recovered <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((R)\)</span>. Archetypal <em>SIRs</em> are measles or chickenpox, i.e., diseases that confer lifelong immunity (but see cite{KGlassandBTGrenfell2004}). An individual starts his life in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> state and may progress to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> state. The rate of progression of individuals from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> is called the incidence rate or force of infection <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\lambda)\)</span> which is a function of contact rate, probability of transmission per contact and density of infectious individuals. Individuals stay in the infectious period for a certain time and then move to the recovered state where they become immune to new infections. Generally, the removal rate from the infectious class is the inverse of the infectious period (i.e., it is assumed that the duration of infection is exponentially distributed).</p>

</div>
<p>Variations of this model allow cases where infected individuals do not acquire immunity after infection, thus returning to the susceptible pool (<em>SIS</em> model). Another variation is the inclusion of a latent stage to hold individuals that are infected but not infectious to others yet (incubation period). These are the <em>SEIR</em> (with immunity) and <em>SEIS</em> (no immunity) models.</p>
<p>Next, we describe in more detail each one of these models in their deterministic and stochastic versions, as used by EpiGrass.</p>

<dt><strong>SIR models</strong></dt><dd><p>Examples of diseases represented by SIR models are measles, chickenpox. Some diseases that do not confer lifelong immunity may be represented by this model if only short term dynamics is of interest.

Besides the three equations describing the dynamics of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>, a fourth equation explicitly defines the number of new cases per time step, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L(t)\)</span> (i.e., the incidence).

<h2>Network transportation models<a class="headerlink" href="#network-transportation-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-10">The transmission models describe the dynamics of infection in a well-mixed population. EpiGrass allows the user to model the movement of infectious individuals between well-mixed populations, thus simulating the spread of disease through space. EpiGrass represents geographical space as a network where cities or localities are nodes and transportation routes are edges. The term network refers to the framework of routes within a system of locations, identified as nodes or sites. An edge is a single link between two sites (a road, a railroad, an air route or a river/sea corridor).</p>
<p>Transportation networks, like many networks, are generally embodied as
set of locations and a set of links representing connections between
those locations. The arrangement and connectivity of a network is
known as its <em>topology</em>. Major types of topology are
illustrated in figure ref{fig:artgraphs}. Velocity and direction of
disease spread depend on the topology and weight of the edges of the
transport network and there are many properties of networks that may
useful when analyzing the spread of diseases. EpiGrass calculates a
set of these properties as described in chapter <a class="reference internal" href="analysis.html#analysis"><span class="std std-ref">Analysis</span></a>.</p>
<p>In a transportation network, each edge (or link) is characterized by a variable <em>flow</em> which states the number of passengers that travel through that link per unit time. EpiGrass uses this information to calculate the number of passengers arriving at each city, per time step. For example, consider node <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N1\)</span> in figure <a class="reference internal" href="#simpnet"><span class="std std-ref">A simple transportation network</span></a>. At each time step, it receives 10 passengers from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N2\)</span>, 5 from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N5\)</span>, 1 from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N4\)</span>. Now suppose that, at this time step, 10% of the population within each site is infectious (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> state), according to the epidemic model. Thus, a total of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\% \times 10 + 10\% \times 5 + 10\% \times 1 = 1.6\)</span> infectious individuals are visiting site <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N1\)</span>. In the epidemic model embedded in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N1\)</span>, EpiGrass sets <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n = 16\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta = 1.6\)</span>. This calculation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is based on a deterministic argument. The other possibility, allowed by Epigrass, is to define <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> as a random variable, that follows a binomial distribution with parameters <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>,:math:<cite>p</cite>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is as given in the deterministic version and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is the proportion of infectious individuals in the source population. From version 1.4 on, EpiGrass can also take into account the specific delays of each connection. When the average speed of the transportation system is set to a value greater than zero, epigrass calculates the time required to complete each trip and attributes this delay (in units of time) to the parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span>. So, the number of infectious passengers arriving at any given city, at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> corresponds to the number of infectious passengers that left the city of origin at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\delta\)</span>.</p>

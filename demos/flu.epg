[THE WORLD]
#==============================================================#
# Here you add information about the files that describe the network

# "shapefile" is the map layer that will be used as a background for 
# the simulation display. It is defined as a list with three elements:
# the .shp filename, the variable containing the site's names,
# and the variable containing unique integers to be used as geocodes.
# ex: shapefile =  ['shape.shp','sitename','sitecode']

# "sites" and "edges" are the files that describe the topology of the
# network (see Documentation)
# The encoding variable can be set to a string stating the encoding of your 
# sites and edges files. If left empty, iso-8859-1 (latin-1) is assumed.
# See Usermanual for acceptable encoding strings.

[EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL]
#==============================================================#
#model types available: SIS, SIS_s ,SIR, SIR_s, SEIS, SEIS_s, SEIR, SEIR_s, 
# SIpRpS, SIpRpS_s,SIpR,SIpR_s,Influenza or Custom (see documentation for description).
modtype = Influenza

#==============================================================#
[MODEL PARAMETERS]
#==============================================================#
#  They can be specified as constants or as functions of global or 
#  site-specific variables. Site-specific variables are provided
#  in the sites .csv file. In this file, all columns after the 4th
#  are collected into a values tuple, which can be referenced here 
#  as values[0], values[1], values[2], etc.
#   Examples:
#   beta = 0.001
#   beta=values[0] #assigns the first element of values to beta 
#   beta=0.001*values[1]
#   beta=0.001*N  # N is a global name for total site population

# Currently, Epigrass requires that parameters beta, alpha, e, r, delta, B, w, p
# be present in the .epg even if they will not be used. Do not erase these lines. 
# Just disregard them if they are not useful to you.

# Required parameters

beta = N*(0.08*(1-(1.-1./N)**7)+0.0001*(1-(1-1./N)**(0.5*N/values[1])))

e = 0.5       # inverse of incubation period
r = 0.25      # inverse of infectious period (4 dias)
delta = 1     # probability of acquiring full immunity [0,1]
B = 0         # Birth rate
w = 0         # probability of immunity waning [0,1]
p = 0         # Probability of a recovered become infected per time step[0,1]

[INITIAL CONDITIONS]
#==============================================================#
#   Here, the number of individuals in each epidemiological
#   state (SEI), at time 0, is specified. They can be specified in absolute
#   or relative numbers.
#   N is the population size of each site.
#   The rule defined here will be applied equally to all sites.
#   For site-specific definitions, use EVENTS (below)

#   Examples:
#   S,E,I = 0.8*N, 10, 0.5*E
#   S,E,I = 0.5*N, 0.01*N, 0.05*N
#   S,E,I = N-1, 1, 0
# Note. Epigrass expects to find S,E,I here. If not, an error will occur
# Variable names below must match names defined in model if using custom model

[EPIDEMIC EVENTS]

#  Specify isolated events.
#  Localities where the events are to take place should be identified by the geocode (sites'3th column).
#  All coverages must be a number between 0 and 1.
#  Seed:   n infected cases will be added to sites 1 and 2 at time 0.
#  Seed : [('site1's geocode','variable', n),('site2's geocode','variable', n)]. 
#  
#  Vaccinate: vaccination campaign will vaccinate a proportion cov of the susceptible population at time t
#  Vaccinate: [('locality's geocode', t, cov)]
#  Multiple vaccination campaigns with specific coverages can be specified as lists (see manual) 
#  Vaccinate: [('locality1's geocode', [t1,t2], [cov1,cov2]),('locality2's geocode', [t1,t2], [cov1,cov2])]
